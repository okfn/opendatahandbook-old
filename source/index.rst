The Open Data Handbook
======================

**This handbook discusses the legal, social and technical aspects of 
open data.** It can be used by anyone, but is especially 
designed for those seeking to **open up** data. It discusses the 
**why, what, and how** of open data — why to go open, what open is, 
and how to 'open' data.

To get started, you may wish to look at the :doc:`Introduction <introduction/index.html>`. You can 
navigate through the report using the Table of Contents (see sidebar 
or below).

We warmly welcome comments on the text and will incorporate feedback 
as we go forward. We also welcome contributions or suggestions for 
additional sections and areas to examine.
