The Open Data Manual
====================

**This report discusses legal, social and technical aspects of 
open data.** The manual can be used by anyone but is especially 
designed for those seeking to **open up** data. It discusses the 
**why, what and how** of open data -- why to go open, what open is, 
and the how to 'open' data.

To get started, you may wish to look at the Introduction_. You can 
navigate through the report using the Table of Contents (see sidebar 
or below).

We warmly welcome comments on the text and will incorporate feedback
