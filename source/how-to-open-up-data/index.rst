How to Open up Data
====================

This section forms the core of this manual. It gives concrete, detailed 
advice on how data holders can open up data. Here we’ll go through the 
basics, but also cover the pitfalls. Lastly, we will discuss the more 
subtle issues that can arise.

There are three key rules we recommend following in opening up data:

 * **Keep it simple.** Start out small, simple and fast. There is no 
   requirement that every dataset must be made open right now. Starting 
   out opening up just one dataset, or even one part of a large dataset 
   is fine -- of course the more datasets you can open up the better.

   Remember this is about innovation. Moving as rapidly as possible is 
   good because it means you can build momentum and learn from experience 
   -- innovation is as much about failure as success and not every dataset 
   will be useful.

 * **Engage early and engage often.** Engage with actual and potential 
   users and reusers of the data as early and as often as you can. Be 
   they citizens, businesses, developers. This will ensure that the next 
   iteration of your service is as relevant as it can be.

   It is essential to bear in mind that much of the data will not reach 
   ultimate users directly but rather via ‘info-mediaries’. These are the
   people who take the data and transform or remix it to be presented. 
   For example most of us don’t want or need a large database of GPS 
   coordinates, we would much prefer a map. Thus, engage with infomediaries 
   first. They will reuse and repurpose the material.

 * **Address common fears and misunderstandings**. This is especially 
   important if you are working with or within large institutions such as 
   government. When opening up data you will encounter plenty of questions
   and fears. It is important to (a) identify the the most important ones  
   and (b) address them at as an early stage as possible.

There are four main steps in making data open, each of which we will cover 
in detail below. These are in very approximate order - many of these can 
be done simultaneously.

   1. **Choose your dataset(s).** Choose the dataset(s) you plan to make 
      open, though keep in mind you can (and may need to) return to this 
      step if you encounter problems at later stages.
   2. **Apply an open license.**
       
       1. Determine what intellectual property rights exist in the data.
       2. Apply a suitable ‘open’ license that licenses all of these  
          rights and supports the definition of openness discussed in 
          the section above on ‘What Open Data’
       3. NB: if you can't do this go back to step 1 and try a different 
          dataset.
   
   3. **Make the data available** - in bulk and in a useful format. 
      You may also wish to consider alternative ways of making it available 
      such as via an API.
   4. **Make it discoverable** - post on the web and perhaps organize 
      a central catalogue to list your open datasets.
