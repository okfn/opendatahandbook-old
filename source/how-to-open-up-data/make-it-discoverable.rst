Make data discoverable
======================

:term:`Open data` is nothing without users. You need to be able to make 
sure that people can find the source material. This section will cover 
different approaches.

The most important thing is to provide a neutral space  
which can overcome both inter-agency politics and future budget cycles. 
Jurisdictional borders, whether sectorial or geographical, can make 
cooperation difficult. However, there are significant benefits in joining 
forces. The easier it is for outsiders to discover data, the faster new 
and useful tools will be built.

Existing tools
--------------

There are a number of tools which are live on the web that are specifically
designed to make data most discoverable.

The most prominent is CKAN.net. CKAN stands for the Comprehensive Knowledge
Archive Network, and is a catalogue of all datasets in the world. The site 
makes it very easy for developers to find the material that they're seeking.

In addition, there are dozens of specialist catalogues for different 
sectors and places. Many scientific communities have created a catalogue 
system for their fields, as data are often required for publication.


For government
--------------

As it has emerged, orthodox practice is for a lead agency to create a 
catalogue for the government's data. When establishing a catalogue, try to 
create some structure which many departments can keep their own
information current easily.

Resist the urge to build the software to support the catalogue from scratch.
There are many free and open source software solutions which have been
adopted by many dozens of governments already. Investing in another 
platform will be a waste of resources.

There are a few things that most open data catalogues miss. Your programme
could consider the following:

* Providing an avenue to allow the private and community sectors to add
  their data. It may be worthwhile to think of the catalogue as the region's
  catalogue, rather than the regional government's.
* Facilitating improvement of the data by allowing derivatives of datasets
  to be catalogued. For example, someone may geocode addresses and may 
  wish to share those results with everybody. If you only allow single 
  versions of datasets, these improvements remain hidden. 
* Be tolerant of your data appearing elsewhere. That is, content is likely
  to be duplicated to communities of interest. If you have river level
  monitoring data available, then your data may appear in a catalogue
  for hydrologists.
* Ensure that access is equitible. Do not create a priviledged level of 
  access for officials or tenured researchers. This will cause resentment 
  and ultimately undermine the goals that you are seeking to achive.


For civil society
=================

Be willing to create a supplementary catalogue for non-official data.

It is very rare for governments to associate with unofficial or 
non-authoritative sources. Officials have often gone to great expense to 
ensure that there will not be political embarrasment or other harm 
caused from misuse or overreliance on data.

Moreover, governments are unlikely to be willing to support activities 
that mesh their information with information from businesses. Governments 
are rightfully skeptical of profit motives. Therefore, an independent
catalogue for community groups, businesses and others may be warranted.
