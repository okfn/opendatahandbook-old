Why Open Data?
==============

:term:`Open data`, especially :term:`open government data`, 
are a tremendous resource that is largely untapped. Many different 
individuals and organisations collect a broad range of different types 
of data to be able to perform their tasks. Government is particularly 
significant in this regard, both because of the quantity and centrality 
of the data they collect, but also because of all that government data, 
most is public data by law, and therefore could be made open and made 
available for others to use. Why is that of interest? 

There are many areas where we can expect open data to be of value, 
and where examples already exist. There are also many different groups 
of people and organisations who can benefit from the availability of 
open data, including government itself. At the same time it is impossible 
to predict precisely how and where value will be created. The nature of 
innovation and new things is that it will come from unlikely places. 

It is already possible to point to a large number of areas where open 
government data is creating value, and there are likely more. Some of 
these areas are:

* Transparency and democratic control
* Participation
* Self-empowerment
* Improved or new private products and services
* Innovation
* Improved efficiency of government services
* Improved effectiveness of government services
* Impact measurement of policies
* New knowledge from combined data sources and patterns in large data 
  volumes


Examples exist for most of these areas. 

For transparency there are projects such as the Finnish ‘tax tree’ and 
British ‘where does my money go’ that show how your tax money is being 
spend by government. Or there’s the case of how open data saved Canada 
$3.2 billion in charity tax fraud. Also various websites, such as the 
Danish folketsting.dk, track activity in parliament and the law making 
processes, so you can see what exactly is happening, and which 
parliamentarians are involved.

Open government data can also help you to make better decisions in your 
own life, or enable you to be more active in society. A woman in Denmark 
built findtoilet.dk with all Danish public toilets so people she knew 
with bladder problems now trust themselves to go out more again. In the 
Netherlands a service, vervuilingsalarm.nl, is available that warns you 
with a message if the air quality in your vicinity is reaching a 
self-defined threshold tomorrow. In New York you can easily find out 
where you can walk your dog, as well as find other people who use those 
parks. Services like ‘mapumental’ in the UK and ‘mapnificent’ in Germany 
allow you to find places you can live, given a certain commute time to 
your work place, prices of housing, and how beautiful an area is. All 
these examples are using open government data.

Economically open data is of great importance as well. Several studies 
have estimated the economic value of open data at several tens of 
billions of Euros yearly in the EU alone. New products and companies 
are re-using open data. The Danish husetsweb.dk helps you find ways 
to improve the energy efficiency of your home, including financial 
planning and finding builders who can do the work. It is based on 
re-using catastral information, information about government subsidies 
as well as the local trade register. Google Translate uses the enormous 
volume of EU documents, that appear in all European languages, to train 
the translating algorithms, thus improving its quality of service.

Also for government itself open data is of value. Efficiency can be 
increased for instance. The Dutch Ministry of Education has published 
all of their education related data on-line for re-use. Since then the 
number of questions they receive has dropped reducing work load and 
costs, but the remaining questions now are easier to answer for civil 
servants as well, because it is clear where the relevant data to answer 
those questions can be found. Open data is also making government more 
effective, which ultimately also reduces costs. The Dutch department 
for cultural heritage is actively releasing their data and collaborating 
with amateur historical societies and groups like the 
Wikimedia Foundation to execute their own tasks more effectively. 
This not only results in improvements of the quality of their data, 
but will also make the department smaller. 

While there are numerous instances where open data is already creating 
both social and economical value in very diverse ways, at the same time 
we don’t know yet what new things will become possible. New combinations 
of data can create new knowledge and insights, that lead to whole new 
fields of application. We have seen that in the past, such as when 
Dr. Snow in London discovered the relationship between drinking water 
pollution and cholera in the 19th century, by combining data about 
cholera deaths with the location of water wells. This led to the building 
of London’s sewage systems, and meant a huge improvement in general 
health of the population. We will likely see that as well when unexpected 
insights flow from combining open data sets.

This untapped potential can be unleashed if we turn public government 
data into open data. Only, however, if it is really open, so if there 
are no restrictions (legal, financial or technological) to the re-use 
by others. Every restriction will exclude people from re-using the 
public data, and make it harder to find valuable ways of doing that. 
For the potential to be realized, the public data needs to be open data.
